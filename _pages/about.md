I am a second-year PhD student at the [MTUPC](https://mt.cs.upc.edu/) group at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), supervised by [Marta R. Costa-jussà](https://costa-jussa.com/) and [Carlos Escolano](https://es.linkedin.com/in/carlos-escolano-ba26549a). Before starting my PhD, I completed a MsC Data Science also at UPC, during which I worked part-time at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/).

My research focuses on interpertability and analysis of NLP models, Machine Translation, and the combination of both. I am also interested in Speech Translation, low-resource MT and fairness topics among others. Apart from research, I am also a teaching assistant at several courses in the Computer Science and Telecommunications departments at UPC.

In the following months I will be working as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon.
