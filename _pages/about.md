I am a final year PhD student at the [MTUPC](https://mt.cs.upc.edu/) group at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), supervised by [Marta R. Costa-jussà](https://costa-jussa.com/). During my PhD I have been fortunate enough to do research internships at [AI at Meta (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/), in the Machine Translation team at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), and in the Books Science team at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/). Before starting my PhD, I completed a MsC Data Science also at UPC, during which I worked part-time at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/).

My research focuses on interpretability and analysis of NLP models, with a broader interest in Explainable AI. My current focus revolves around understanding Language Models, while also exploring areas such as Machine Translation and multilingual NLP. Apart from research, I have also been a teacher assistant at several courses in the Computer Science and Telecommunications departments at UPC.

I'm on the job market for 2024. If you believe there is a potential match, please feel free to reach out.
