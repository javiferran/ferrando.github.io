I am a third-year PhD student at the [MTUPC](https://mt.cs.upc.edu/) group at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), supervised by [Marta R. Costa-jussà](https://costa-jussa.com/). Currently I'm working as a Research Scientist Intern at [Meta AI (FAIR)](https://ai.facebook.com/). Previously, I've done research internships in the Machine Translation team at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), and in the Books Science team at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/). Before starting my PhD, I completed a MsC Data Science also at UPC, during which I worked part-time at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/).

My research focuses on interpretability and analysis of NLP models, Machine Translation, and the combination of both. I am also interested in low-resource, multilingual, and efficient NLP, Speech Translation, and robustness topics among others. Apart from research, I have also been a teacher assistant at several courses in the Computer Science and Telecommunications departments at UPC.
